We are the BLIXIES. Hyperspace Helpers from BLIXION. We were navigating
Hyperspace when we opened the portal to enter the Milky Way Galaxy; we
 were curious about our human friends, so we decided to approach and
 maybe revisit planet Earth. When we began the orbit near your moon, by
looking down, we noticed that the vibrant blue planet that we once visited
was in profound chaos and darkness. We heard an explosion that turned the
already pitch-black night sky even darker as we came closer. Dark shapes
 darted in and out of the shadows. Almost invisible grey creatures were
spitting out dark sticky, toxic energy balls on humans, locking them in grey
  boxes, inducing fear and negative energy into their souls. We heard
screams of fear and human souls shouting, begging for help... We answered
 the call, and we are here to help free all human souls and bring vibrant
          rainbow bliss energy back to Planet Earth.
We established Intergalactic collaboration immediately; the Great Masters
allowed us to connect once again with the fearless STAR HEROES that have
descended to Planet Earth. We will guide you to victory that will eliminate
     the Grey Dictator's regime and annihilate his dark minions.
